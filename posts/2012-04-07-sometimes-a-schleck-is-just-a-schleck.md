title: "Sometimes a Schleck is Just a Schleck"

Ever since the photo of Andy Schleck in his national champion flavored Radioshack-Nissan kit was released, it bothered me. The design itself was appealing enough, clean and simple and structured as it is. No, it was a nagging image buried somewhere in my brain, just one more piece of cycling ephemera buried under layers and layers of equally useless nostalgia and trivia.

But before long, I gave up, and the quandary slipped my mind. Weeks went by, and this being cobble season - Andy wasn’t very visible in his tidy little tricolor kit, so I wasn’t reminded of the question. And so I forgot about it entirely, until this morning.

I was chatting with a friend about Roger Sterling’s office design, and how I really admired the discipline necessary to design completely without color. “But aren’t you color blind?” he asked. “Yeah, pretty severely.” I answered.

The conversation turned to cigarettes, elevators, wingtips, and then back to the interior office design. “Do you remember the episode with the painting?” he asked. “Um, yeah, it was an [Ellsworth Kelly](http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3048), right?” I said. “Oh come on, did you even take art history in college? [It was a Rothko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrxxmuspoJM),” he said.

But just as he said those words, an image popped into my head. It was a real Eureka! moment. The image in my head was of a dress that Kelly had designed in the early 50s during his time in France. Surely the Radioshack-Nissan kit designer also had this image in his or her head too.

I mean, this can’t be a coincidence, can it?

But boy, do I like me some Color Field painting. Even if I can’t really discern the colors themselves. And maybe even more so because of it.
