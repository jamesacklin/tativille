It's been five long years in the works, but The Process is finally getting dialed.

1. Come by the shop for a chat and fit.
2. We'll design something awesome.
3. Your frame will be hand built right here in the good ole' USA by a master craftsman.
4. Your wheels will be hand built right here in good ole' Wicker Park.
5. We'll put it all together.
6. Take it home and get Rad.
