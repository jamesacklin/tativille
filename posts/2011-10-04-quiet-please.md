There are too many whiny, squeaky, sad little bicycles in Hyde Park. Do you and your bicycle a favor and [make an appointment](\%22mailto:appointments@taticycles.com\%22) to get it tuned up. Mention this post and it's \$20 off.

It will come back to you clean and quiet and happy and ready to ride like the old days.
