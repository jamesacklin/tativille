I'm pretty much snooper chuffed that we've had 121 racers participate in the Calumet Practice Crits so far this year. And among them, 24 had never before raced. Plus we're seeing about 20% ladies, which is more than double the rate at a typical Chicagoland race.

And so now we've had partipants between the ages of 14 and 58, categories 1 through 5. Experienced riders are dusting off their wintry trainer legs, newbies are learning what a "paceline" is, and folks are reconnecting and making new friends.

All. Good. Things.

But do you know what the best thing is? The very, most special, bestest thing is? The best thing that's happened so far is how Paul and Molly showed up yesterday in full Cipo zebra regalia.
