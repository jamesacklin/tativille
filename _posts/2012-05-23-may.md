That thing where you forget there's a shop website and start to think that the entirety of your customer base is on Twitter 24/7.

After five years that felt like twenty-five, the shop relocated Parks - from Hyde to Wicker. The new space is a bit smaller, but has a ceiling fan, which is pretty exciting. There's a rat-infested alley behind the shop, which isn't as bad as it sounds... because the building's crumbling facade has exposed some pretty stellar brickwork. So at least the bike photos will look sick.

The petite footprint has necessitated some inventory discipline, and thing have gotten pretty pared down. In fact, about 85% of the old shop's inventory was closed out or donated to local non-profits earlier this month. But at the same time, there's a lot of new newness happening.

- Catlike helmets & glasses
- Search & State apparel
- Linus city bikes
- Abus locks
- Vittoria Classics shoes
- Skratch
- CRAFT bibs
- Veloflex tubulars
- H+Son rims
- Hyperlite Mountain Gear
- Argon18 road frames
- Swrve apparel
- 5bling gloves

And that's just for starters. So stay tuned, y'all. I guess at this point, the best way to do so is via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. (see the icon links at the top of the page).
