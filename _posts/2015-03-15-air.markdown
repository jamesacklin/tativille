A good air pump, even one that gets heavy daily use, my mechanical mentor once told me, should last a decade or more. By &ldquo;good air pump&rdquo; he meant Silca. And by &ldquo;or more&rdquo; he meant &ldquo;or two&rdquo;.<br/>I&rsquo;ve owned several Silca pistas and superpistas over the years. I&rsquo;ve bemoaned the resin bases. Cheered the limited edition colorways and return of wooden handles. I&rsquo;ve rebuilt them dozens of times, and except in the case of the pump that fell from the roof of a six story building (don&rsquo;t ask) &ndash; have not yet lived to see one die. Sometimes, as a housewarming gift to the next tenant, when moving from an apartment, I will leave a freshly rebuilt Silca in the closet. This is a much better gift than a ficus or a goldfish.

I hate selling floor pumps that aren&rsquo;t Silcas, because I know that, sooner or later (and admittedly with some of the newer, nicer designs, it&rsquo;s later) &ndash; they will die. They will die an unaspirated, exasperated death: bursting a gasket, tearing a hose, or sometimes decoupling from a poorly welded base. And other pumps, no matter what the manufacturer tells you, are simply not rebuildable. Silca pumps, on the other hand, are a joy to rebuild. In fact, since you can count the constituent parts of a Silca pump on one hand, they are also quite simple to rebuild.

Some of the Tatitos were complaining last week that the race-day superpista wasn&rsquo;t working properly. Sure enough, this 1996 model was in need of a fresh leather (!) plunger and a presta rubber grommet. It&rsquo;s been fixed now, and quite honestly this is a shame. It&rsquo;s a shame because it&rsquo;s cross season, and not track season, and it won&rsquo;t be able to prove it&rsquo;s mettle by bringing a tubular to 10 bar in a couple dozen strokes.
