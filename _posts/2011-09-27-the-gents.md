Although our cyclocross participation rate is twice that of road, we're looking forward to developing a fresh crop of novice road racers for 2012. Interested parties should plan on racing at least twelve times over the course of the season, have a schedule flexible enough to allow for group training, and bring an open mind and a willingness to learn. Mustaches not required.

Our program will be shifting back to the club's original focus on skills development and mentoring young riders in all aspects of training and racing. Moving forward, as racers naturally upgrade and matriculate, TATI will assist in their placement on clubs with larger numbers of higher category riders.

Interested parties should contact [2012@taticycles.com](mailto:team@taticycles.com).
