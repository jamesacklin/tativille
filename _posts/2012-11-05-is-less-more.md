I had a dream the other night that Mies van der Rohe visited Chicago and he joined me for a coffee at [Wormhole](https://twitter.com/wormholecoffee). He was all, "Look, Dawg, you've been hustlin' the same game now for years, and what do you have to show for it?"

I stared down at my shoes and mumbled something stupid and defensive.

"I mean, just because the industry puts out a mountain of disposable and superfluous crap, doesn't mean you need to rep it." He paused, swirling his swizzle, and continued. "How many busted Superflashes do you need returned until you draw the line and refuse to sell them? How many broken \[redacted\]? How many cracked carbon rimz? I could go on..."

"But what am I supposed to do? I don't exactly have a Maybach Music clientele, you know?"

"Lemme tell you a story. One day I was chillin' with Charles-Ã‰douard Jeanneret, you know, 'Le Corbusier'... homeboy was going on and on about his new book and how he was gonna totally slay with his twenty-five points of architecture. And, you know, Charlie isn't the best conversationalist to begin with, but after about the tenth point I was all like, 'Dood, maybe you should stick with seven, or even just five points - just talk about the stuff you know.' and it's a damn good thing he did, cuz [it turned out pretty good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Savoye). So, it's like, look - maybe just stick with the stuff you know, that you can control, and forget about everything else."

"Le Hm."

"Le Hm indeed, bro."

TO BE CONTINUED.
